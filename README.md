## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Skills I actively misuse:

- **Competitive De-programming** (turning O(n) into O(e^n))
- **Manual Memory Leaking** (who needs `free()`?)
- **Template Meta-programming** (to ensure nobody, including me, can read the code)
- **Neovim Configuration** (80% of my "coding" time)
- **Deep Misunderstanding** (specifically of Neural Networks)
- **Cache Trashing** (optimized for maximum latency)
- **Pointer Arithmetic** (strictly into forbidden addresses)
- **Macro Abuse** (making C++ look like a language that shouldn't exist)
- **GDB Staring Contests** (I always blink first)
- **Git Force-Pushing** (to ensure the past stays buried)

**It doesn't scale. It barely compiles. It is perfect.**

## 📉 Least Contributed Repo

*That one DSA Library.* Started with grand ambitions. Ended with a half-finished Segment Tree and a heavy sense of dread.

## 🐌 Productivity Meter

```
🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦 Waiting for the compiler...
🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨       Refactoring the config file again
🟥🟥🟥             Existential dread
⬜                 Actual coding
```

## 🧨 Current Projects

- **AI Code Detection Evasion**: Teaching machines to hide from other machines.
- **TCP Chat over carrier pigeon**: High latency, higher stakes.
- **Segment Faulting as a Service (SFaaS)**: Coming soon to a server near you.
- **Rewriting everything in Assembly**: Because life is too long.

## 🕳️ Philosophy

```cpp
std::life is a void function.
It returns nothing.
```

```
The heap is a lie.
The stack is a cage.
Every push_back is just an attempt to fill the emptiness.
```

## 📉 Status

```
[████████████████████] 110% CPU usage
```

- Currently thinking about `nullptr`
- Waiting for the heat death of the universe (or the next internship, whichever is more chaotic)
